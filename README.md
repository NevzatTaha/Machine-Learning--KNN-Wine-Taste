# Machine-Learning--KNN-Wine-Taste
The data set is related to quality of red wine according to different variables.
I have categorized quality in two groups so that I can predict whether it is lower than average or not.
1 - fixed acidity
2 - volatile acidity
3 - citric acid
4 - residual sugar
5 - chlorides
6 - free sulfur dioxide
7 - total sulfur dioxide
8 - density
9 - pH
10 - sulphates
11 - alcohol
Output variable 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10): I have catogorized and labeled as "is_lower_average".
